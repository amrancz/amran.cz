        <h2>My approach to design</h2>
        <p>
        I start every project with learning about the business and its users. I explore the problem thoroughly before designing a solution.

        I value data over opinions and I regard every design as a hypothesis that needs to be tested. I believe designers are facilitators who enable their teams to create good design.

        I like to share my thoughts, knowledge and experience through writing. I publish articles on my blogï»¿ from time to time.
